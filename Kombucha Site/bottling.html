         <h2>Importance of Proper Bottling</h2>
                              
         <p>Bottling is an important element of kombucha making because of its acidity and carbonation. For all carbonated beverages it is important to use pressure safe bottles made for carbonating drinks. 
		 Due to the acidity of kombucha it is not recommended to use plastic bottles like popular soda brands use. Even though many food grade plastics do not leak chemicals into the product it is best practice to avoid them all together, as well as considering the environmental impact of using plastic. 
		 Glass pressure safe bottles are the best to use for kombucha brewing. The industry has gravitated towards the use of glass bottles of twelve to fourteen ounces with screw on lids (which are good to reuse). Many homebrewer also like swing top bottles as they do come in a larger variety of sizes and are easier to source online.
		 Another good option for those who want to expand their homebrewing to making beer as well may want to use capped beer bottles as they can be used for both beverages.
