         <h2>What is Kombucha?</h2>
                              
         <p> Kombucha is a popular fermented beverage brewed prodominatley with  tea and sugar.It is thought to  originate from ancient China 
			in which tea sweetened with honey may have been left out and later realized to be fermented. Kombucha is fermented with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, or SCOBY
			the scoby feeds on the sugar in the sweet tea and produces gluconic and acetic acids as well as carbon dioxide.Kombucha is thought to have a plethora of health benefits because of its
			acids, bacteria, and yeast. Kombucha's popularity has skyrocketed the last ten years as food trends move toward organic and unprocessed foods.
			After the initial fermentation of the tea, fruit and other ingredients are added for a second fermentation to flavor and carbonate the kombucha.

         <h2>Tea and Sugar</h2>
                              
         <p> Choosing the right teas and sugars to use when brewing kombucha is very important. Many types of teas do not yield good results when making kombucha and the same goes for sugars.
			Typically it is best practice to stay towards black and green teas when starting to brew kombucha, the SCOBY tends to have the easiest time with these teas but as you get more
			advanced with brewing, trying white tea or yerba mate could be unique. Sugars are more important becaause they are what the SCOBY feeds on. The most common and effective sugar to use
			is white cane sugar. One might to choose raw or brown sugar but they are too hard on the SCOBY and yield bad results. Another set of bad sugars to use are syrups including honey,maple,agave, etc.
			Artificial sweeteners are also not reccomended because the SCOBY cannot consume them so no fermentation will take place and you will likley kill off your culture.
